It has been almost 4 years since the last post. I got some new thougts to this blog App. The previous code looks a bit of over enginerring. I spent the last long weekend to refactor the code and ended up with rewriting the entire backend with Kotlin. The good part is it has less code this time. Beyond that, I am more satified with the new dependency injection part. All components are organized as a tree hierarchy, instead of everyone can request everything from a giant provider, one component can only access to its explicitly declared dependencies. 
For me, it's a good improvement.
