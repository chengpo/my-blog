All right, I think it is the time for the first post on this new website now.

I am Android developer and also interested to web programming.
I implement this website for playing around frontend skills. 
For people who interested, I write the backend with Java and frontend is base on AngularJS and Bootstrap.
I want to talk more about the implementation details later. Java 8 new features are really exciting.

Most likely the posts are about my findings in my daily coding life.
My favorite topics includes Android, Java, Linux, Design Pattern, so on and so forth.

My old blog is [cpaul.is-programmer.com](http://cpaul.is-programmer.com/), although I haven't update it for a long time. 
I will find a way to migrate the old posts to this new website someday.

It is going to be fun. Bye for now.
